regression models**

**Authors : Souvik Bag, Kapil Gupta, Soudeep Deb**

The selection of essential variables in logistic regression is vital because of its extensive use in medical
studies, finance, economics and related fields. In this paper, we explore four main typologies (test-based,
penalty-based, screening-based, and tree-based) of frequentist variable selection methods in logistic regres-
sion setup. Primary objective of this work is to give a comprehensive overview of the existing literature
for practitioners. Underlying assumptions and theory, along with the specifics of their implementations,
are detailed as well. Next, we conduct a thorough simulation study to explore the performances of sixteen
different methods in terms of variable selection, estimation of coefficients, prediction accuracy as well as
computational time under various settings. We take low, moderate and high dimensional setups and con-
sider different correlation structures for the covariates. A real-life application, using a high-dimensional
gene expression data, is also included in this study to further understand the efficacy and consistency
of the methods. Finally, based on our findings in the simulated data and in the real data, we provide
recommendations for practitioners on the choice of variable selection methods under various contexts.
